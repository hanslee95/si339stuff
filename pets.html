	<h1> PETS </h1>
	<p> These are photos of my dogs, Mookie and Dewey. Mookie is 2 years old and one of the nicest, calmest dogs youâ€™ll ever meet. She will never leave your side. Dewey is 1 years old and she is so energetic. She hates sleeping and would be able to play for the longest time. Both of them love water! <p>
